So we can transfer data and read a signal, but we need a better means of 
accuracy, as it can currently read the same tone emitted, twice, 3 times, or
just skip over it. whether this means a sort of marker variable frequency
to identify it is about to play a tone and another to signify it has finished
playing a tone. or a type of counter number added on to the tone so each 
tone is unique but decipherable on the receiving end.

Brainstorm time :-D
