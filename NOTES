Counting.

Play a base tone of 1000hz, if the first tone is a 1, add 100hz, if a 0 
subtract 100hz and count on the other end by saying:

if thefreq == 1000:
	start reading:
		if the freq is > 1000:
			it's a 1
			and log current frequency to variable
		is the freq is < 1000:
			it's a 0
			and log current frequency to variable

loop back and say if the next freq is > the last, it's a 1, if less, it's a 0

BAM!
