Changelog:
	Version 0.01 - 7/31/2011 -Initial Release of Encoder
	Version 0.02 - 8/04/2011 -Initial Release of Decoder + bug fixes-
	Version 0.03 - 8/11/2011 -(Optional) Added Bz2 Compression in Encoder and Decoder
	Version 0.04 - 8/11/2011 -Added XOR + OTP Encryption (Not Tested Yet)
	Version 0.05 - 8/13/2011 -Added AES256 Encryption, XOR isn't good enough! As usual, can't test decoding, encoding seems faster as well
	Version 0.06 - 8/14/2011 -Fixed AES Encryption, added accurate Hz readout for debugging
	Version 0.07 - 8/15/2011 -Fixed Encryption overall, now works! I <3 Sam Phippen, also decoding needs to be checked
Bugs:
	Fatal Python Error on larger arrays of text/files - In V0.01
