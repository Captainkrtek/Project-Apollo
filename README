Dependencies:
	Python
	Binascii 	
	Linux Only - OSS Sound (Has dependencies of it's own as well)
	Audiere (Has dependencies of it's own as well)
	PyAudiere 
	Numpy
	PyAudio
	PyCrypto - (For AES)
	Linux, Mac OSX, or Windows computer

Steps Linux:
	Install libaudiere-dev from repository:
		may have to add a repo to your /etc/apt/sources.list
	Download PyAudiere source and follow it's readme to Compile
	Follow this guide to install OSS, reboot after installed:
		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenSound
	Limited testing, OSS doesn't play well with my computers

Steps Mac:
	*not tested yet*

Steps Windows:
	Tested: Install all dependencies above, they all work in Windows
	(quite easily actually)

Usage (Linux): user@computer:~$ python encoding.py
       Enter path to file: /home/user/file.txt
       *Tone(s) Playing*
       user@computer:~$ 

Usage (Windows): Simply run the code in IDLE or via the Windows CLI 

Changelog:

	Version 0.02 - 8/04/2011 -Initial Release of Decoder + bug fixes-
	Version 0.03 - 8/11/2011 -(Optional) Added Bz2 Compression in Encoder and Decoder
	Version 0.04 - 8/11/2011 -Added XOR + OTP Encryption (Not Tested Yet)
	Version 0.05 - 8/13/2011 -Added AES256 Encryption, XOR isn't good enough!
	Version 0.06 - 8/14/2011 -Fixed AES Encryption, added accurate Hz readout for debugging
	Version 0.07 - 8/15/2011 -Fixed Encryption overall, also decoding needs to be checked
	Version 0.08 - 8/17/2011 -Modified Decoding.py
	Version 0.09 - 8/23/2011 -Fixed Encoding/Decoding. Changed Encoding Algorithm, added test code
	Version 0.10 - 8/27/2011 -Verified Decoding Algorithm, testing phase with hardware
	Version 1.00 - 9/13/2011 -Verified and Tested, just tinkering now, released binary version
Bugs:
	Fatal Python Error on larger arrays of text/files - In V0.01
	^ Resource issue with PyAudiere 
	Ensure Decoding.py reads frequencies at same rate that encoding.py sends them,
	IE: don't read same Freq. twice
