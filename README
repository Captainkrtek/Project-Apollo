Dependencies:
	Python
	Binascii 	
	Linux Only - OSS Sound (Has dependencies of it's own as well)
	Audiere (Has dependencies of it's own as well)
	PyAudiere 
	Numpy
	PyAudio
	PyCrypto - (For AES)
	Linux, Mac OSX, or Windows computer

Steps Linux:
	Install libaudiere-dev from repository:
		may have to add a repo to your /etc/apt/sources.list
	Download PyAudiere source and follow it's readme to Compile
	Follow this guide to install OSS, reboot after installed:
		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenSound
	Limited testing, OSS doesn't play well with my computers

Steps Mac:
	*not tested yet*

Steps Windows:
	Tested: Install all dependencies above, they all work in Windows
	(quite easily actually)

Usage (Linux): user@computer:~$ python encoding.py
       Enter path to file: /home/user/file.txt
       *Tone(s) Playing*
       user@computer:~$ 

Usage (Windows): Simply run the code in IDLE or via the Windows CLI
